High level experience in web design and development knowledge, producing quality work.
High level of experience in computational and theoretical astrophysics with a sprawling international collaboration network publishing cutting-edge scientific articles. Also a member of world-leading international Consortia such as LIGO, Euclid, AXIS, LISA, and Cosmic Explorer.


* ABOUT
about__description
Web developer, with extensive knowledge and years of experience, working in web technologies and Ui / Ux design, delivering quality work.
Astrophysicist with expertise in multi-messenger astronomy, relativistic astrophysics such as accreting black holes, binary neutron star mergers, and kilonova and supernova explosions and remnants. 
Otherwise, you'll catch me going on hikes/walks and diving into poetry, ecology, sociology, philosophy, TV shows/movies, anime/manga, and their intersections.

* PORTFOLIO
portfolio__description
Data science, computational methods for building models, data processing, using observational data for testing models.
Core experience in applying mathematics, statistics, and data science methods to gravitational wave astrophysics, i.e., how do we probe astrophysical systems with gravitational waves? 
More recently I have branched into multi-messenger astronomy, eg electromagnetic, gravitational and cosmic rays, which is an erupting field of modern astronomy where multiple physical signals, ie messengers, are combined for independent tests of astrophysical systems.
